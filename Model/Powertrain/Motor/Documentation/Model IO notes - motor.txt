params for motor model

Inputs
Is				(bus)
	Id				D-axis current (Adc)
	Iq				Q-axis current (Adc)
omega			motor speed ( rad/sec )

T_in			Coolant temperature at motor input (deg C)
mdot_in			Mass flow rate of coolant (kg/sec)
				FIXME: choose symbol. 

Parameters

n				Number of pole pairs

eta				Motor efficiency lookup structure
	eta.Is			Stator current breakpoints (Is = âˆš(Id^2 + Iq^2)) (A)
	eta.omega		Rotor speed breakpoints (rad/sec)
	eta.eta_m		Motor efficiency (P_mech / P_electrical)
	
theta			Thermal resistance between stator coil and coolant (deg C/W)
Kt				Motor torque constant (Nm / A_rms) - A_rms refers to the stator current Is


Signals


Outputs
tau				Motor output torque, N m
T				Motor coil temperature, deg C

** STRUCTURE

- The model always loads data from "Motor.mat", a mat file with a bunch of Simulink.Parameter objects that represent parameters.
- In the "Data/Configurations" directory, there are a number of other .mat files which can be loaded. Same structure as the "Motor.mat" file. They are for different motor models.
- External scripts are responsible for generating the .mat files in Data/Configurations. They should look at raw test files in "Data/Raw/<motor_config_name>/", interpret it, then write a configuration file to "Data/Configurations/<motor_config_name>.mat".
- There should be an "info" string in "Motor.mat" (and the related matfiles) that describes what the file is, where it came from, and what it does.
