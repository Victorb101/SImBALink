** STRUCTURE

- The model always loads data from "Motor.mat", a mat file with a bunch of Simulink.Parameter objects that represent parameters.
- In the "Data/Configurations" directory, there are a number of other .mat files which can be loaded. Same structure as the "Motor.mat" file. They are for different motor models.
- External scripts are responsible for generating the .mat files in Data/Configurations. They should look at raw test files in "Data/Raw/<motor_config_name>/", interpret it, then write a configuration file to "Data/Configurations/<motor_config_name>.mat".
- There should be an "info" string in "Motor.mat" (and the related matfiles) that describes what the file is, where it came from, and what it does.
