** STRUCTURE

- The model always loads data from "Motor.mat", a mat file with a bunch of Simulink.Parameter objects that represent parameters.
- In the "Data/Configurations" directory, there are a number of other .mat files which can be loaded. Same structure as the "Motor.mat" file. They are for different motor models.
- External scripts are responsible for generating the .mat files in Data/Configurations. They should look at raw test files in "Data/Raw/<motor_config_name>/", interpret it, then write a configuration file to "Data/Configurations/<motor_config_name>.mat".
- There should be an "info" string in "Motor.mat" (and the related matfiles) that describes what the file is, where it came from, and what it does.

In "generate_parameters.m":
	- The routine that generates the motor efficiency map is broken out into a separate function (calculate_efficiency.m), which is stored with the /raw/ data, not common to all datasets. This is to accomodate various sources of efficiency data.
	
	For example, the 228HV calculate_efficiency.m simply reads in the efficiency values from a CSV, since the values are given on a plot from the manufacturer. For a different motor (e.g., the 268MV), calculate_efficiency.m might calibrate efficiency values from a datafile with raw test results. 

In "Data/Raw":
	- There is a file, <motor_config_name>_const_parameters.m. It is a **script** (not a function) that generates Simulink.Parameter objects for the "given" or "constant" parameters (e.g., datasheet mass, or measured mass, for a motor).
