abstract = {Starting with the basic assumption of no saturation or hysteresis, and with distribution of armature phase m. m. f. effectively sinusoidal as far as regards phenomena dependent upon rotor position, general formulas are developed for current, voltage, power, and torque under steady and transient load conditions. Special detailed formulas are also developed which permit the determination of current and torque on three-phase short circuit, during starting, and when only small deviations from an average operating angle are involved. In addition, new and more accurate equivalent circuits are developed for synchronous and asynchronous machines operating in parallel, and the domain of validity of such circuits is established. Throughout, the treatment has been generalized to include salient poles and an arbitrary number of rotor circuits. The analysis is thus adapted to machines equipped with field pole collars, or with amortisseur windings of any arbitrary construction. It is proposed to continue the analysis in a subsequent paper.},

abstract = {The paper describes a methodology to co-simulate, with high fidelity, simultaneously and in one computational framework, all of the main vehicle subsystems for improved engineering design. The co-simulation based approach integrates in MATLAB/Simulink a physics-based tire model with high fidelity vehicle dynamics model and an accurate powertrain model allowing insights into 1) how the dynamics of a vehicle affect fuel consumption, quality of emission and vehicle control strategies and 2) how the choice of powertrain systems influence the dynamics of the vehicle; for instance how the variations in drive shaft torque affects vehicle handling, the maximum achievable acceleration of the vehicle, etc. The goal of developing this co-simulation framework is to capture the interaction between powertrain and rest of the vehicle in order to better predict, through simulation, the overall dynamics of the vehicle. A standard sedan and a US Army's High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) both with conventional powertrain systems are used to demonstrate the proposed co-simulation framework.},

abstract = {A novel speed control algorithm for permanent magnet synchronous motor s (PMSM) which maximizes efficiency without requiring phase current sensors is proposed in this thesis. The algorithm is described for a buried magnet type interior permanent magnet (IPM) motor but it is also suitable for surface mount type motors. The suggested algorithm implements maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) control in a PMSM drive system, considering the parameter variations due to magneti c saturation and change in temperature. Only DC link current, DC bus voltage and mechanical speed are used in the implementation of the algorithm, eliminating the requirement for three phase current measurements. The scheme employs an online search algorit hm with an initial condition computed from a - prior i system information. Hybridization of the search algorithm with pre - computed control coefficients ensures robustness against parameter variations while maintaining good dynamic performance. The proposed sc heme is implemented on a 1.5 HP IPM and the validity of the approach is justified through experimental and simulation results.},
